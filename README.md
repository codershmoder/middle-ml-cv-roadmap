# Middle ML Engineer – Computer Vision Roadmap

This repository contains my learning path toward a Middle ML Engineer role focused on computer vision:
- Deep learning for images (CNNs, Transformers)
- Classic CV (optical flow, homography, SLAM basics)
- TensorFlow / PyTorch, OpenCV, SciPy, NumPy

## Setup

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cv-ml
jupyter lab
